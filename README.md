In this repository, we are utilizing Tableau to create identify the bike usage in NYC during an August timeframe from CITI Bikes. 

To view our Tableau data, please use this link: https://public.tableau.com/profile/benjamin.lew8746#!/vizhome/Bikechallenge/Story1

We have generated 8 different analysis, looking at volume of usage, bikes used, duration and user type.
The following images are the representation of the data found.

## Summary
This analysis can be useful in identifying what is the general customer base and where the heavier usage is located. From the data, we can identify that the primary usage is for Male users during commuting hours. On the "Starting and ending points" slide, we can see that the general usage will focus in a near the central part of the map. If we were to use this information, we can identify that cities that have commuters that are able travel on a 20 minute bike ride will be benificial to these types of services. If we want to dive deeper, we would need to identify what is the usage during different weather conditions such as snow and heat.
